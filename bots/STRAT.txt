1. every castle should know where every other castle is

2. Pick the spot with the MOST karbonite.
3. Send a single pilgrim+preacher to that spot.

- the church NEVER attacks. It builds enough preachers, and maintains a ratio of pilgrim:preacher = 1:1

3. pick off N-1 castles VIA preachers.
4. defend with preachers (2+)

5. crusader + preacher MACRO has to be strong


BREAKDOWN BY UNIT:
castle:
    - determine each other's locations
    - send the initial pilgrim + preacher to a deposit (give the pilgrim a church location)
    - coordinate an enemy castle to attack
    - send waves of preachers to attack the enemy castles
    - keep track of dead enemy castles.

church:
    - keep track of the single clump (how many pilgrims do you need?)
    - keep track of all troops (they should all be in visible_range)
    - build a pilgrim:preacher ratio of 1:1
    - if you see any enemies, broadcast a DEFEND signal with enemy_location

preacher:
    if in DEFEND mode:
    - find a spot that is as close to base as possible such that there are diagonal gaps in between + not on fuel/karbonite.
    - if you recieve an attack signal, actively attack the enemy at that location
    - if you have resources, and neighbors that are closer than you to the castle, give resources to neighbors.
    - castleTalk that the enemy is dead

pilgrim:
    - go to the location you were told, find a NEARBY spot to mine, and mine it.
    - whenever you can afford to build a church, build it at the location you were told to.
    - if you see an enemy, move out of its attack range.
    - if you don't see an enemy, either mine or deposit.
