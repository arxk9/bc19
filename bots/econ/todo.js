/* MASSIVE TODO LIST

1. pick a better church_loc, that is adjacent to as many spots as possible,

2. pick an order of clusters, along with whether they need to be defended.

3. send defensive units WITH the pilgrims.

4. write pilgrim, to go to clusters nice and quick

7. pilgrims should also track the economy, because it may be useful to have them run
back and forth while it's not cost effective to build a church.

8. change the active defense of churches to be better

9. plan which buildings need to get lattices, and build those lattices.
                            --- I AM HERE ---
10. tune those lattices to face the enemy if relevant.

6. track the economy more carefully, then tune this so you can do it efficiently.

11. use econ to decide which round it makes sense to spawn crusaders at, and then do that.

12. redo enemy attack order based on scouts

13. keep track of which resource spots we need to attack

14. add hording back in to go back and attack those resource spots

15. add scouts to those hordes when necessary

/* MAYBE DO LATER

5. spawn pilgrims from churches for other clusters, as opposed to from one cluster
